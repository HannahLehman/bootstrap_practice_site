# Code Challenge

- **Audience**: Front End Developers
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Exercise**: HTML/CSS Responsiveness

## Your Challenge

`index.html` implements a simple responsive page using a custom css framework.

Your challenge is to rebuild the included `index.html` as `new.html` using a popular responsive framework (ex: bootstrap, foundations, etc) of your choice.

## Your Solution

The `new.html` contains a minimal starting point for you to use.

Your solution should look and work like the sample page **without** the use of javascript.

### Before starting

- Resize your browser and observe the various behaviors of the page at different screen sizes.
- Choose a framework that you're comfortable working with, ideally one that's actively maintained and well documented.

### Extra credit

The header text in the sample page isn't responsive.

Make it responsive for extra credit.

## Returning Submissions

TODO: Depends on how we're asking for them. If this is being emailed out vs github, etc.
